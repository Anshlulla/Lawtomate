      "**III. Benefits**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The framework is effective in generating scripts with high cosine similarity between the input prompt and the generated script.\n",
      "* Automated scriptwriting reduces the time and effort required for scriptwriting.\n",
      "* Scalable and high-quality scripts can be created, enabling writers to focus on improving the script idea itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Limitations**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Existing tools primarily focus on general text generation, neglecting the development of systems that can accommodate customizable elements such as character descriptions, behaviors, and scene settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**V. Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "* By providing prompts and context to LLMs or RAG systems fine-tuned on movie script datasets, individuals can generate scripts and make changes according to their preferences without worrying about the underlying complexities of text generation.\n",
